- Hi, I’m @codes-from-nate
- I have created a Github profile to find project ideas as well as save and share my own. 
- I am currently an Industrial Engineer and have a great deal of experience working with Lean tools. I am looking to learn more about coding and automation both at a consumer and industrial level. 
- In my free time I enjoy playing with my 2 dogs, going on walks through the woods with my partner, and photographing them all!
